NCT06680765,"An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of a Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health Component for Matasa Matan Arewa and Smart Start Targeting Married Adolescent Girls in Nigeria and Ethiopia","Evidence on the effectiveness of interventions aimed at creating demand and access to pre-conceptual and antenatal care (ANC) among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) from sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. A program called Adolescents 360 (A360) led by Population Services International in Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania supports adolescent girls to identify contraceptives as a relevant tool for enabling them to pursue their self-defined life aspirations. Avoiding or delaying childbirth is crucial for AGYW to pursue their life goals, but motherhood remains a vital aspiration for many. A360 respects these aspirations and supports AGYW to pursue motherhood when the time comes, safely and aligning with their unique preferences. In 2022, A360 set out to design a maternal, neonatal and child health (MNCH) component that would be layered to the existing sexual and reproductive health interventions in Ethiopia and Nigeria. A360 employed human-centered design (HCD) to design these components. The implementation of these components in real-world settings began in 2023. A360 has designed an evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the MNCH components in improving the AGYW's comprehensive knowledge of what is needed to pursue healthy pregnancies, increase their self-efficacy to access ANC and garner support from their key influencers in the process of pursuing healthy pregnancies. The evaluation's primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of the MNCH components at increasing comprehensive knowledge, self-efficacy and key influencer support to pursue healthy pregnancies among married AGYW in Nigeria and Ethiopia. The secondary objectives are: (a) to evaluate the component's effectiveness at increasing comprehensive knowledge of what care is required to attain healthy pregnancies, (b) to evaluate the component's effectiveness at increasing self-efficacy to attend ANC, (c) to determine the component's efficacy at eliciting support from AGYW's key influencers when they are pursuing healthy pregnancies, and (d) to surface the system-level barriers, facilitators, and opportunities for program improvement during the implementation of the MNCH components. The MNCH components are implemented in Kaduna and Jigawa states in Nigeria and in Oromia, Sidama, Amhara, South and Central regions in Ethiopia. The evaluation is based in the same geographies where the components are implemented. The evaluation uses an implementation-effectiveness hybrid design, blending an outcome evaluation and an implementation science component. The outcome evaluation constitutes of a quantitative survey using a longitudinal approach with two study arms, an intervention, and a comparison arm. It has three assessments: a recruitment phase, and two follow-ups (3 months after recruitment and 8 weeks post-partum (only for pregnant AGYW).

Participant recruitment is conducted using recruitment scripts after obtaining oral consent and the administration of a set of screening questions to assess eligibility. Full consenting procedures are executed and written consent obtained prior to involvement in any of the evaluation components. A structured questionnaire is used to gather quantitative data from the survey using a Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) approach. Furthermore, FGD, IDI and KII facilitation guides are used to gather qualitative data. During this process, all sessions are audio-recorded. Audio records are transcribed verbatim and translated. Data is collected by trained enumerators and qualitative researchers who are certified to conduct human subjects' research. Analysis of quantitative data will follow a repeated measures approach employing generalized estimating equations. The repeated measurements of each subject will be made at two times. Between group t-tests and chi-square tests of comparison will be conducted to identify secondary outcomes which show statistically significant differences between participants in the intervention and comparison arms. The qualitative data transcripts will be rigorously analyzed using NVivo or Dedoose. Open-coding and closed-coding will be utilized to identify themes in the qualitative data. Claim statements attributing change to key intervention drivers will be drawn from narrative stories of program beneficiaries guided by the intervention's theory of change.

The evaluation received ethical approvals from Ethiopian Midwives Association (EMwA) Institutional Review Commitee (IRC) and the PSI Research Ethics Board (REB) prior to the enumerators training and field data collection. Subsequently, the ethical approval letters were submitted to the sub-national health departments for their reference and support in the management of the field work.",Pre-conceptual Care|Antenatal Care|Postpartum Family Planning|Adolescent Maternal Health,"Comprehensive knowledge of what is needed to pursue a healthy pregnancy, The proportion of AGYW who have 'comprehensive' knowledge of what is needed at conception to attain a healthy pregnancy.

NCT06676956,The SEQUENCE Trial: Evaluating Diagnostic Yield of Robotic-assisted Bronchoscopy When Staging EBUS is Performed First or Second in the Same Procedure,"Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RaB) has afforded proceduralists the ability to accurately reach the periphery of the lung for biopsy of pulmonary nodules1. This has paved the way for patients to undergo both biopsy of a peripheral nodule and a staging linear endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in the same anesthesia event, promoting quicker throughput from discovery of a lesion to guideline-adherent treatment2. Further, introduction and mainstream utilization of cone-beam CT (CBCT) has provided the bronchoscopist the ability to refine needle position with tool-in-lesion confirmation3. While there are no randomized clinical trials promoting efficacy of RaB and CBCT in comparison with other bronchoscopic methods, in single center retrospective studies, diagnostic yield has consistently proven to be in the 70-85% range, superior to prior technologies4-6.

One of the limitations of utilization of RaB and CBCT is the detrimental effect that atelectasis plays in the bronchoscopy procedure. This can lead to false positive radial EBUS (rEBUS) signals and non-diagnostic procedures7. This incidence of atelectasis has been evaluated prospectively, using a protocol featuring 8-10 cmH2O of PEEP and limiting hyperoxia8, and results suggest this ventilator strategy does an adequate job preventing intraprocedural lung collapse. However, this study only evaluated incidence of atelectasis and did not elaborate on its impact on diagnostic yield.

Further unknown is the optimal sequence of performance of RaB and a staging linear EBUS in patients with a radiographically normal mediastinum. Starting with either the RaB or Linear EBUS both have their pros and cons. The benefit to performance of a linear EBUS first is the potential to obviate the need for peripheral nodule biopsy by obtaining rapid, on-site pathologic feedback of occult nodal disease, reducing some of the risk of the procedure (i.e. bleeding and pneumothorax).6 Conversely, the pitfalls to performing linear EBUS first is the possible contribution of atelectasis resultant of the increased time from intubation to peripheral nodule biopsy, blood in the airway causing bronchospasm, and resorption atelectasis from hyperoxia9. There are no prospective data evaluating this in a randomized fashion, but one Monte Carlo simulation (with assumption of diagnostic yield from navigational bronchoscopy of 70% when performed first and 60% when performed second) suggested a higher diagnostic yield and less need for repeat procedure in the navigation first group, despite a 10% assumption of occult nodal disease10.

As outlined in the specific aims above, the overarching goals of this study are to assess in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial performed by members of the Interventional Pulmonary Outcomes Group (IPOG), whether sequence of staging EBUS plays a role in diagnostic yield, incidence of atelectasis, and safety outcomes in patients undergoing RaB.",Pulmonary Nodules,"Diagnostic yield from the procedure, This will be an outcome measure that is positive or negative based on whether a diagnosis was achieved during the procedure, This will be assessed 30 days after the procedure in a study visit that our teams conduct, it will not include the patient","Atelectasis, Using the IPOG atelectasis score (three outcomes) we will track the impact atelectasis has on the biopsy and diagnostic yield, This will be assessed day of procedure and recorded",2024-11-10,"Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/56/NCT06676956/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/56/NCT06676956/ICF_001.pdf"

NCT06668077,Inhibitory Control Training and iTBS for Excess Weight: Behavioral and Brain Changes (InhibE).,"People with excess weight (EW) are characterized by high impulsivity, high levels of craving for high-calorie foods, deficits in inhibitory control, and maladaptive decision-making. These characteristics are related, at the brain level, to alterations in the activation of areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and its connectivity. The proposed intervention seeks to target these issues. Thus, the present study aims to characterize the effects of neuromodulation with intermittent theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) of the DLPFC alone and in combination with inhibitory control training to produce brain, cognitive and behavioral changes, and modify altered biological parameters in people with EW. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) a group that will receive active iTBS of the DLPFC combined with inhibitory control training with a food Go/No-go paradigm, (2) a group that will receive active iTBS of the DLPFC only, and (3) a control group that will receive sham iTBS. It is hypothesized that the combined intervention will obtain better results that the neuromodulation alone, and that both interventions, compared to sham iTBS, will achieve: (i) decreased body mass index, (ii) decreased craving, (iii) modified brain connectivity and activation both at rest and linked to task performance with food stimuli, (iv) improved anthropometric measures (waist circumference and waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios), (v) improved eating and exercise behaviors (decreased caloric intake and increased frequency and time of physical activity), (vi) improved emotional symptoms and emotional eating (depression, anxiety, emotional regulation, emotional eating, reward-related eating, non-homeostatic eating), (vii) improved cognitive abilities (motor and cognitive inhibition, delay of gratification, impulsivity, working memory, cognitive flexibility and decision making), (viii) changes in biological parameters associated to the interventions (plasma and microbiota), and (ix) advantages in cost-effectiveness and cost-utility based on economic evaluation analyses.","Overweight and Obesity|Inhibition, Psychological","Body Mass Index (BMI), Change in BMI: Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2.

Participants are instructed to score points by answering with a knob if the image is surrounded by a green circle, but not to press when the image is surrounded by a red circle. The presentation of the images is the same as in the FoodTrainer application: 50% of the images are food, with 100% of the healthy ones being presented under the 'Go' condition and 100% of the unhealthy ones under the 'No-Go' condition. The remaining 50% are non-food images, with 50-50% paired with 'Go' and 'No-Go' cues. In addition, participants can choose which categories of unhealthy foods they want to train. Brain activation to Go vs. No-Go stimuli and food vs. non-food stimuli will be compared. The task will be analysed to assess the brain activity associated with the task, using a psychophysiological interaction analysis(PPI)., Pre-treatment assessment (week 2) and post-treatment assessment (week 6)","Changes in Food decision-making (neuroimaging measures), The Neveu et al. (2018) task will be used, which consists of three phases: two rating phases and one decision phase with 50 food images. Participants have to answer on a 5-point Likert scale how healthy they consider the food to be (block 1) and how much they like the taste of the food (block 2). In the third block, the participant decides whether they prefer to eat a neutral reference food (calculated from the previous two blocks) or an alternative food. These forced choices lead to cognitive conflict when the reference food is considered tastier and the alternative food healthier or vice versa. Among trials with cognitive conflict, the choice of the healthier food is defined as a controlled choice, and the choice of the tastier food as an uncontrolled choice. Activation will be compared between the controlled vs. uncontrolled choice conditions.

Mean change from baseline at post-intervention, Coping subscale of the Palatable Eating Motives Scale (PEMS) will be used to evaluate the intentionality for eating palatable foods to face negative emotions. The coping subscale includes items that are scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale, the total range being from 5 to 25 points. Low scores indicate that the person rarely resorts to the consumption of pleasant foods as a strategy to cope with negative emotions or stressful situations. High scores suggest that the person frequently uses palatable food as a strategy to cope with stress or negative emotions, which may be related to unhealthy eating habits or emotional eating patterns., Pre-treatment assessment (week 2), post-treatment assessment (week 6) and follow-up (week 18)|Emotion Regulation Strategies. Mean change from baseline at post-intervention, The Emotion Questionnaire (ERQ) consists of 10 items to examine cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression strategies.

NCT06667817,Exercise From Afar: Progressing At Risk Individuals to Independent Exercise,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a technology-driven independent exercise program on health outcomes associated with dementia risk among underactive rural adults.

Underactive adults (n=50), ages 40-70 years, from federally designated rural and frontier Kansas counties will be recruited to participate in this study. Specific inclusionary and exclusionary criteria will be used to screen potential participants and determine eligibility. Following recruitment and screening, participants will complete baseline physical fitness and health assessments, supervised by the research team. Following completion of baseline assessments, a personal training/fitness app will be employed to design and deliver exercise programming and track exercise participation, adherence and progression over the course of the study. All prescribed exercise will follow national governing body recommendations and include specific exercises found in previous work to be beneficial for physical health and brain plasticity. The study team will record exercise instruction videos that can be accessed by all participants at any time throughout the study. The particular app used will allow the research team to organize exercise videos into structured training sessions, allowing participants to exercise on their own, at the location of their choice, with ample instruction. The app will also allow participants to record themselves performing various exercises and send them to the research team for analysis of technique and safety. Communication between study personnel and participants will be delivered via the app. Phone calls and/or Zoom sessions will be offered as an alternative if necessary. Our goal is to create a safe, effective means of delivering personalized exercise programming to rural adults that reduces barriers to exercise, improves physical fitness and biomarkers associated with dementia risk and lends itself to exercise adherence in a population that is at an increased risk for cognitive decline. Middle aged adults will be included in the study as they are at an age when successful behavior change is more probable (than older, institutionalized adults); older adults will be included as they are in the high-risk category for dementia.
